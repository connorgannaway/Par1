notes for amadeus:
- I like our idea of easy to use interface, however i feel sometimes
  i'm not seeing what i want to without navigating multiple pages. Maybe incorporate a way
  to switch to a grid mode as a way to input or just as an overview.
- I'm torn between our idea of steppers and the other app's idea of choosing a score
  from a popup. Less clicks to input.
- I do think a homepage would be good. Starting on a blank game without inputing settings
  or on the settings screen could be overwhelming or confusing in regards to navigating
  the app.
- I think distinction between front nine and back nine can be good.
- Maybe the only time you visit settings is at the beginning of a game. Visiting again prompts
  the creation of a new game.

ideal total feature list:
- score tracking for unlimited number of players
- history of courses/choose course in settings for prefilled pars
- easy to input scores and pars
- game overview
- history of past games and scores. view all or sorted by course
- trends. view all or sorted by course
